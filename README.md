# Examples of very basic AMReX GPU functionality 

Starting with OpenACC, might try other things later

## Planned (in order of implementation and difficulty)
- Particle to Particle
- Grid to Particle
- Particle to grid (local only)
- Particle to grid (including remote deposition)
- geometric PIC (essentially line integral deposition)
